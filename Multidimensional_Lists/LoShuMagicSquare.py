    The Lo Shu Magic Square is a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns.
    Lo Shu Magic Square has the following properties:
    â€¢ The grid contains the numbers 1 through 9 exactly.
    â€¢ The sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to the same number.    This is a program that uses a function that accepts a 2-D list as an argument to determine if the list is a Lo Shu magic square or not.
