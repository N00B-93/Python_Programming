Welcome to my Python learning repository! Here you'll find a collection of Python programs that I've written while learning the language. Each directory is designed to showcase different concepts and techniques in Python.

## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my journey in learning Python. As I progress, I'll be adding more directories covering various topics in the future.

## Concepts

Here's a brief overview of the Python concepts included in this repository:

1. **Elementary Programming**: Basic operations like arithmetic, input/output, and variable assignment.
2. **Selections**: Using conditions (if-else, if-elif-else) to execute specific blocks of code based on certain criteria.
3. **Mathematical Functions, Characters and Strings**:  Operations and manipulations involving numbers, characters, and strings.
4. **Loops**: Repeating a block of code until a certain condition is met (for and while loop).
5. **Functions**: Encapsulating blocks of code into reusable functions with parameters and return values.
6. **Lists**: Storing and accessing a collection of elements of the same type in a linear fashion.
7. **Multidimensional Lists**: Arrays with more than one dimension, like matrices or tables.
8. **Objects And Classes**: Modeling real-world entities with attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods).
9. **Strings And Special Methods**: Strings in Python are sequences of characters, while special methods, denoted by double underscores, enable customization of object behavior such as initialization and representation.
10. **Inheritance And Polymorphism**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, while polymorphism enables objects to take on different forms, often achieved through method overriding.
11. **Exception Handling And Text I/O**: Dealing with errors and handling input/output operations.
12. **Database Programming**: Interacting with databases to store and retrieve data using SQLite3.

## How to Use

Each program is contained in its own directory along with any necessary resources or instructions. To run a program, follow;
```bash
python fileName.py
```
